This Sweet Shop Management System is a web application designed to streamline day-to-day operations for a sweets store, with dedicated views for both admins and regular users. It provides an intuitive, card-based interface with rich visuals for products and an analytics-driven dashboard to help monitor sales and inventory at a glance.
The system supports two main roles: Admin for managing the shop and User for browsing and placing orders. Admins get full control over products, inventory, orders, and customer insights, while users experience a clean storefront-like interface to explore sweets and interact with the shop.
